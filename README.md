MS-SSA-LSTM for Enhanced Stock Price Prediction
MS-SSA-LSTM integrates multi-source data, sentiment analysis, swarm intelligence, and deep learning to deliver accurate stock price predictions, especially in volatile markets.

Model Highlights
Sentiment-Enhanced Forecasting:
Leverages sentiment analysis from East Money forum posts to capture market psychology and sentiment-driven behavior.

Swarm Intelligence Optimization:
Uses the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) to optimize LSTM parameters, boosting model performance and predictive precision.

Hybrid Architecture:
Combines Multi-Source Attention (MSA), SSA, and LSTM into a powerful hybrid model for deep time series prediction.

Why MS-SSA-LSTM?
✅ Outperforms traditional LSTM-based models
✅ Adapts well to dynamic and uncertain environments
✅ Suited for short-term stock prediction in China’s volatile stock market
✅ Enables more informed, data-driven trading decisions
